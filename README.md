## Reflection

This assignment was completed to give me experience in conducting an audit and write a report based upon my findings. I feel that this was extremely helpful and gave me a template for conducting an actual audit. Some of the skills I feel gained are delving through security framework documentation, international regulations, and U.S. standards for cybersecurity.
